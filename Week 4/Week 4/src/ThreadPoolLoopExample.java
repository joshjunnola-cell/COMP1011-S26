/*
 * This program demonstrates the use of an ExecutorService with a fixed
 * thread pool of 3 threads. Five tasks are submitted and
 * executed concurrently. Each task pauses for a random
 * amount of time to simulate work, allowing us to observe
 * that tasks may complete in different orders. The program
 * also shows how threads are reused from the thread pool.
 * Cocurrency - Multiple threads exist, they progress independently, one may wait while the other runs
 * Not parallel execution- can occur if there are multiple CPU cores
