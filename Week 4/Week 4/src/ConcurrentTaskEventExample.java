/*
 * This program demonstrates concurrent task execution using a fixed thread pool
 * together with event handling using CompletionService.
 *
 * Each task performs REAL WORK (file writing), then completes after a
 * random delay. CompletionService acts as an event system that detects
 * when tasks finish and allows the main thread to respond in completion order.
 *
 * This program demonstrates:
 *
 * 1. Concurrency:
 *    Multiple tasks execute independently using a thread pool.
 *
 * 2. Real Work:
 *    Each task writes to a file and simulates processing time.
 *
 * 3. Event Handling:
 *    The main thread reacts to task completion events using:
 *    - take() → waits for next completed task (event trigger)
 *    - get()  → retrieves task result
 *
 * 4. Ordered Event Logging:
 *    log.txt is written ONLY by the event handler (main thread),
 *    ensuring it matches actual completion order.
 *
 * Event Model:
 *
 * Event Source   : Worker threads (tasks)
 * Event          : Task completion
 * Event Handler  : Main thread using CompletionService
 *
 * Real-life examples:
 *
 * - Order processing system:
 *   Kitchen prepares orders (tasks) and a display system updates
 *   when each order is completed.
 *
 * - Warehouse logistics:
 *   Packages are processed in parallel and tracking system updates
 *   when each package is finished.
 *
 * - Cloud computing:
 *   Jobs run on multiple servers and monitoring system reacts when
 *   each job completes.
 *
 * Concurrency vs Parallelism:
 * - Concurrency: tasks progress independently
 * - Parallelism: tasks may run simultaneously on multi-core CPUs
