/*
In event-driven systems, decoupling in event handling means designing components so they don’t depend directly on each other to work together.
Instead of one part of a system calling another part directly, it emits an event, and any interested components can respond to that event independently.

The event producer should not need to know who consumes the event.
That separation is what “decoupling” means in event handling.

Why this is useful
1. Easier maintenance
You can change one component without breaking others.
2. Better scalability
Multiple systems can react to the same event.
3. Reusability
Components become more independent and modular.
4. Cleaner architecture
Business logic stays separated.

The provided code is an event driven file monitoring system

This Java program is a file system watcher. Its purpose is to monitor a specific directory and react when new files are created, updated, deleted

WatchService → the main watcher (interface)
FileSystems → factory to create it
Path / Paths → represent file system paths
WatchKey → represents a registered watch
WatchEvent → represents an event (like file creation)
StandardWatchEventKinds → predefined event types (create, modify, delete)
